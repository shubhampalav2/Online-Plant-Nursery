    available in the nursery, plants sold, sales records, barcode handling and also estimates the best 
    sales and best customer, and also handles most accounting systems also for employees.

    managing Plant Sales Issues, Plant Availability, Calculating /Managing Plants Growth Stage and 
    Generating Reports. In addition, it can generate the barcode for particular plant. The barcode 
    generation module helps the nursery owners/managers to create bar codes for plants available in 
    the nursery. The barcode generation module also provisions for printing and generating reports. 
    The customer's status of buying is maintained in the nursery database. The customer's details can 
    be fetched by the nursery owner/manager from the database as and when required.</span>
